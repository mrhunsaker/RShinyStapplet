<h1>SRiS Applets</h1>

<p>The following applets have been converted from the early Java versions to use modern browser features. They appear to work very well with the latest versions of IE (9+), Chrome (desktop and mobile), Firefox and Opera, on both desktop and mobile. File saving does not work on Safari, but all else should. Many features do not work on IE 8 or earlier; if you are on one of these early browsers, please consider upgrading to a modern browser to make full use of the software.</p>
